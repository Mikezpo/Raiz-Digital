# Raiz Digital Accounting Website

This is a simple website for Digital Accounting, developed for a freelance client. The website has been built using HTML5, CSS3 and JavaScript, and is designed to be a user-friendly platform in promoting this new way of dealing with digital accouting, making the business workload easier to manage.

At the moment, the website is in its basic form, but I am continuously working to improve it and add more features to enhance the user experience. This includes adding more intuitive navigation, better visual design and improved functionality.

One of the current areas of focus is the form section, which is not currently connecting properly to the email address provided. I am working to resolve this issue and make sure that the form functions as expected.

In summary, this is a simple but effective website for digital accounting, and I am committed to continuously improving it to provide the best possible experience for my clients.
